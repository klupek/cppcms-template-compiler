What is this: alternative template compiler for cppcms template files
Why: for fun, for sport and to add some magic to templates 

What seems to be working:
	- compiling templates used in cppcms projects into almost (see below) identical cpp code (using compatibility mode)

What needs to be done:
	- more test cases, also negative (erroneous) ones
	- better error reporting 
	- more magic 

Known generated code differences (from original cppcms_tmpl_cc), using compat mode:
	All result files from my and original cppcms_tmpl_cc are preprocessed (joined adjacent c-strings, replaced \" with \x22) and indented (using GNU indent) before comparing.
	tests/tutorial-2*.tmpl-x - tests/tutorial-2.diff
		#include moved to first line (when parsing multiple files)
		collaped skin namespace(closing, opening the same namespace)
		whitespaces before '^' and <% item %> not trimmed


Tests:
	All test files are used as DATA, not CODE, therefore they do not infect code with licenses..
	tests/cppblog-admin-caching.tmpl was fixed:
		original:
			<% template master_content() %>
			<div id="form" %>
		fixed: 
			<% template master_content() %>
			<div id="form">
