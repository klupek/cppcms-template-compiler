Known generated code differences (from original cppcms_tmpl_cc), using compat mode:
	tests/tutorial-2*.tmpl-x - tests/tutorial-2.diff
		#include moved to first line (when parsing multiple files)
		collaped skin namespace(closing, opening the same namespace)
		whitespaces before '^' and <% item %> not trimmed


Tests:
	tests/wikipp-*.tmpl are GPL3 licensed code files used as DATA, therefore they do not infect parser code with GPL virus.
	tests/cppblog-*.tmpl look like GPL code files (according to './media/orangesky-rtl.css:License: GPL'), and they are used as DATA, therefore they also do not infect parser code with GPL virus.
	tests/cppblog-admin-caching.tmpl was fixed:
		original:
			<% template master_content() %>
			<div id="form" %>
		fixed: 
			<% template master_content() %>
			<div id="form">
	rest of the test files includes code copied from cppcms tutorial licensed under GFDL, and they are also used as DATA.
